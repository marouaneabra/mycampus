Urban architectural form is Cui&rsquo;s subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cui&rsquo;s exhibition for the FRONT Triennial&mdash;her first solo presentation in the United States&mdash;comprises paintings, drawings, and 3D printed sculptures. Her work weaves together incongruous architectural quotations, from sources as varied as the sleek anonymity of the International Style and the figurative iconography of Socialist worker imagery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The theme of architecture acts as a common thread in three Oberlin exhibitions presented by the Allen Memorial Art Museum as part of the <a href=\"http://www.frontart.org/\" target=\"_blank\">FRONT International: Cleveland Triennial for Contemporary Art</a>. From July 14 to September 30, Cleveland, Akron, and Oberlin host more than 100 artist commissions, performances, films, and public programs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During FRONT, the Baron Gallery is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Friday and Saturday, and 1-5 p.m., Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cui Jie&rsquo;s exhibition was commissioned by FRONT and is presented with support from the Eric and Jane Nord Family Fund, the Nord Family Foundation, and Antenna Space, Shanghai.</p>\r\n",
